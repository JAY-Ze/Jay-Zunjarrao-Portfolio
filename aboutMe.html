                        Hi! I’m Jay, an Engineering graduate and a passionate Software Development Engineer , blending
                        creative thinking with technical skills to build software solutions that make a difference.
                        Whether it's crafting intelligent IoT systems or designing responsive web apps, I love solving
                        problems with code.
                        <p>My journey in software development began with a fascination for technology and a desire to
                            build innovative applications that solve real-world problems.</p>
                        <p>💡 Over the years, I’ve worked on diverse projects such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A Solar-Powered Grass Cutter using ESP32 and automation</li>
                            <li>A Facial Recognition System for visually impaired users with Raspberry Pi</li>
                            <li>A responsive Car Catalogue Website to explore global car brands</li>
                            <li>A flashcard app to learn Japanese Kana Characters</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        I’ve also freelanced as a graphic designer, completed virtual internships in Robotics and AI/ML,
                        and organized coding events like Codewars, designing technical quizzes for college peers.
                        <p>🚀 I’m currently focused on:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developing backend APIs with Node.js & Express</li>
                            <li>Advancing my skills in Java and DSA</li>
                            <li>Exploring full-stack development and AI-driven applications</li>
                            <li>Learning Flutter and Dart development</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                </div>

                When I’m not coding or designing, I enjoy diving into the world of technology, creativity, and
                lifelong learning.
                <div>
                    <p>📝 I write blogs about emerging tech trends, gadgets, and sometimes even about lifestyle topics
                        that inspire me — combining logic with introspection. Sharing thoughts through words helps me
                        sharpen my thinking and connect with like-minded people.</p>
                    <p>📚 I’m also a book lover, always on the lookout for insightful reads that expand my worldview.
                        Lately, I’ve been learning a new language as a side hobby — not just to communicate, but to
                        better understand different cultures and ways of thinking.</p>
                    <p>🎨 My creative side shows up in my interest in color theory, typography, and visual design. I
                        often explore how to create clean, intuitive UI by studying design systems and modern web
                        aesthetics.</p>
                    <p>🎬 I’m also passionate about video editing and storytelling — editing content using DaVinci
                        Resolve and creating 3D animations in Blender. It’s fascinating how animation and editing can
                        turn raw ideas into engaging visual experiences.</p>
                    <p>🧠 I have a deep interest in cutting-edge technology, especially in areas like semiconductors,
                        chip design, graphics, and computing innovations. I love understanding how modern tech is built
                        and how it’s constantly pushing boundaries.</p>
                </div>
                All these interests not only keep me curious and inspired, but also enrich the way I build software —
                with more context, creativity, and clarity.
